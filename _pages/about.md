Hello, and welcome to my page. I am **Jinhong Wang**, a Research Associate at **Imperial College London** in the **Sustainable Energy Technology and Turbomachinery Laboratory (SETTL)**. My research centres on **non-ideal compressible fluid dynamics (NICFD)** and **computational fluid dynamics (CFD)**, with a particular focus on characterising flow losses near the critical point of supercritical carbon dioxide and their implications for turbomachinery performance.  

I obtained my **PhD in Mechanical Engineering** at Imperial College London in 2025, with a thesis entitled:  
> *“Supercritical Carbon Dioxide’s Non-ideal Fluid Effects on Turbomachinery Performance Near the Critical Point.”*  

My work has been recognised with several international distinctions, including **Best Paper Award** and **Best Podium Award** at leading conferences, as well as publications in journals such as *Physics of Fluids* and the *Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power*.  

Prior to my doctoral studies, I graduated with a **First Class Honours MEng in Mechanical Engineering** from Imperial College London (2017–2021). I was named to the **Dean’s List every year** and awarded the **Governor’s MEng Prize** in 2021 as the top graduate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering.  

My wider research interests span **NICFD**, **CFD**, and **AI4Science**.
