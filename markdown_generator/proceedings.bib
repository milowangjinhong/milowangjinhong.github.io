  abstract = {Fig. 1. The introduced gripper consists of one base differential and two finger differentials to split the power from the motor to both fingers, and transfer the power to both proximal and distal phalanges, respectively. When one of the phalanges is in contact with the object, the differential mechanisms keep other joints moving thus achieving adaptability. These differentials combined with return springs also add a mechanical passive disturbance rejection to the gripper. For example, after the differential-based gripper grasps an object (a sphere in the figure) (a), unexpected external disturbance forces applied to the fingers can be rejected as fingers move coordinately keeping grasping posture (b). Once the disturbances are released (c), the fingers and grasped object are able to return to the original grasping position (d). Abstract-We introduce an underactuated differential-based robot gripper able to perform self-adaptive grasping with passive disturbance rejection. The gripper utilises three car differential systems to achieve self-adaptiveness with a single actuator: a base differential for distributing power from the motor to the fingers, and two independent finger differentials for controlling the proximal and distal joints. Linear and torsional springs are cleverly added to these differentials to allow the return of the fingers and the gripper-object system to equilibrium, thus enabling the gripper rejecting unexpected external forces applied to the fingers after securing a grasp. This novel design provides passive disturbance rejection without implementing complicated control systems and is the main contribution of this paper. Moreover, the differentials allow the gripper to perform not only self-adaptive power grasp but also precision grasp, provide it with a large force transmission efficiency, and facilitate the prediction of grasping position. We analyse the static model of the introduced differential system and evaluate the gripper design via four sets of experiments. Numerical and empirical results clearly demonstrate the viability of the proposed grasper.},

  abstract = {In the field of robotic hands, tendon actuation is one of the most common ways to control self-adaptive underactuated fingers thanks to its compact size. Either differential or direct drive mechanisms are usually used in these systems to perform synchronised grasping using a single actuator. However, synchronisation problems arise in underactuated grippers whose position of proximal joints varies with time to perform manipulation operations, as this results in a tendon-driven system with dynamic anchor pulleys. This paper introduces a novel passively compliant idler mechanism to avoid unsynchronisation in grippers with a dynamic multi-tendon routing system, such that adequate grasping contact forces are kept under changes in the proximal joints' positions. A re-configurable palm underactuated dexterous gripper is used as a case study, with the performance of the proposed compliant idler system being evaluated and compared through a contact force analysis during rotation and translation in-hand manipulation tasks. Experiment results clearly demonstrate the ability of the mechanism to synchronise a dynamic tendon routing gripper.

  abstract = {This paper aims to study the mixing loss characteristic of sCO2 near the critical point and shed light on the non-ideal fluid effect on the mixing losses. As a simplified model of the mixing process in the trailing edge or tip leakage flow in turbomachines, a case of mixing in a constant area adiabatic duct involving two streams of parallel flows is studied by control volume analysis. Both perfect gas and non-ideal fluid calculations are carried out for comparisons. The isolated and coupled effects of the two mixing streams' temperature, velocity, and pressure differences on the loss are investigated. The study shows that non-ideal fluid mixing produces significantly higher losses when compared to the equivalent perfect gas estimation. It also reveals that the non-ideal fluid mixing loss is sensitive to the average thermodynamic states of the mixing streams. A general trend is that the closer the temperature is to the critical point, the higher the loss is observed. This is particularly apparent for the temperature and pressure mixings, while the mixing loss due to the velocity difference is less affected. A significant variation of the mixing loss coefficient is reported if the static state of any of the two streams is near the critical point, which is mainly caused by the significant variation of the temperature gradient regarding the entropy along the isobar. In addition, a positive combined effect of the temperature, velocity, and pressure differences was found for mixing loss. The results also show that the change in the mixing loss due to the variation of one property difference between mixing streams is almost independent of the other property difference. This behaviour matches the conclusion drawn in literature for perfect gases [1]. The results from this simple case contribute to understanding the mixing loss behaviour differences between perfect gas and non-ideal fluids in sCO2 turbomachinery and hold significance for the development of mean-line models.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to provide an understanding of sCO2 inviscid adiabatic normal shock behaviour near the critical point and to develop an explicit tool for faster prediction of the shock relations that can aid the supercritical turbomachinery design process. An iterative algorithm was developed to compute shockwave behaviours for non-ideal fluids. Three important shock behaviour parameters were investigated: post-shock Mach number, shock strength, and polytropic efficiency. A comparative study was carried out between air (ideal gas assumption), ideal gas CO2 (ideal gas assumption), and non-ideal fluid CO2 (Span-Wagner equation of state). The distinct differences show the inadequacy of the perfect gas shock relations when predicting sCO2 shock behaviour near the critical point. The results of non-ideal fluid calculations show a general trend of stronger shock strengths and higher polytropic efficiencies towards lower pre-shock entropy conditions. This is also distinctive near the critical point due to the reduced speed of sound. Finally, explicit expressions for these parameters were retrieved using symbolic regression. The fitted models have significant improvements compared to the prediction from perfect gas shock relations with a 5-20\% point reduction in relative errors. This study also shows the potential for machine learning to be applied in non-ideal fluids effects modelling and the methodology developed in this paper can be easily introduced to other working fluids in their ranges of interest.},
