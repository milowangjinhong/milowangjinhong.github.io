  abstract = {Background: Knee alignment affects the development and surgical treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Automating femorotibial angle (FTA) and hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA) measurement from radiographs could improve reliability and save time. Further, if HKA could be predicted from knee-only radiographs then radiation exposure could be reduced and the need for specialist equipment and personnel avoided. The aim of this research was to assess if deep learning methods could predict FTA and HKA angle from posteroanterior (PA) knee radiographs. Methods: Convolutional neural networks with densely connected final layers were trained to analyse PA knee radiographs from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database. The FTA dataset with 6149 radiographs and HKA dataset with 2351 radiographs were split into training, validation, and test datasets in a 70:15:15 ratio. Separate models were developed for the prediction of FTA and HKA and their accuracy was quantified using mean squared error as loss function. Heat maps were used to identify the anatomical features within each image that most contributed to the predicted angles. Results: High accuracy was achieved for both FTA (mean absolute error 0.8{$^\circ$}) and HKA (mean absolute error 1.7{$^\circ$}). Heat maps for both models were concentrated on the knee anatomy and could prove a valuable tool for assessing prediction reliability in clinical application. Conclusion: Deep learning techniques enable fast, reliable and accurate predictions of both FTA and HKA from plain knee radiographs and could lead to cost savings for healthcare providers and reduced radiation exposure for patients.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to provide an understanding of sCO2 inviscid adiabatic normal shock behavior near the critical point and to develop an explicit tool for faster prediction of the shock relations that can aid the supercritical turbomachinery design process. An iterative algorithm was developed to compute shockwave behaviors for nonideal fluids. Three important shock behavior parameters were investigated: postshock Mach number, shock strength, and polytropic efficiency. A comparative study was carried out between air (ideal gas assumption), ideal gas CO2 (ideal gas assumption), and nonideal fluid CO2 (Span--Wagner equation of state). The distinct differences show the inadequacy of the perfect gas shock relations when predicting sCO2 shock behavior near the critical point. The results of nonideal fluid calculations show a general trend of stronger shock strengths and higher polytropic efficiencies toward lower preshock entropy conditions. This is also distinctive near the critical point due to the reduced speed of sound. Finally, explicit expressions for these parameters were retrieved using symbolic regression. The fitted models have significant improvements compared to the prediction from perfect gas shock relations with a 5--20\% point reduction in relative errors. This study also shows the potential for machine learning to be applied in nonideal fluid effects modeling and the methodology developed in this paper can be easily introduced to other working fluids in their ranges of interest.},

  abstract = {Isentropic processes are crucial in engineering as they represent idealized processes and serve as reference conditions for thermodynamic analyses. Existing methods for calculating isentropic processes in non-ideal fluids are either too slow for practical engineering applications [equation of state (EOS) approach] or inaccurate (classic modified polytropic isentrope equation: Pv{$\kappa$}=Const. where exponent {$\kappa$} is the isentropic expansion coefficient). This paper proposes a novel isentrope equation, Pv{$\lambda$}=Const., with a path-specific exponent {$\lambda$} correcting for {$\kappa$} variation in generic non-ideal fluid isentropic processes. The benefit of this approach is that it maintains the isentrope equation's polytropic form, so that the explicit isentropic relations can be derived, enabling straightforward and rapid calculations and a better physical understanding. Using supercritical carbon dioxide as the fluid to test the hypothesis, the proposed isentropic relations accurately calculate the stagnation state within 2\% of the exact EOS calculation, whereas the classic isentropic relations have errors up to 50\%. Additionally, the fitted {$\lambda$} function is explicit and can calculate the stagnation state approximately 15--20 times faster than the EOS approach. Moreover, the results of two other non-ideal fluids, hexamethyldisiloxane and R-143a, are included to prove the robustness and general applicability of the proposed equations. This method strikes a balance between accuracy, simplicity, and computational speed for calculating isentropic processes in non-ideal fluids, offering greatly simplified expressions for thermodynamics modeling in engineering applications such as turbomachinery reduced-order models and design optimizations.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to study the mixing loss characteristic of supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) near the critical point and shed light on the nonideal fluid effect on the mixing losses. As a simplified model of the mixing process in the trailing edge or tip leakage flow in turbomachines, a case of mixing in a constant area adiabatic duct involving two streams of parallel flows is studied by control volume analysis. Both perfect gas and nonideal fluid calculations are carried out for comparisons. The isolated and coupled effects of the two mixing streams' temperature, velocity, and pressure differences on the loss are investigated. The study shows that nonideal fluid mixing produces significantly higher losses when compared to the equivalent perfect gas estimation. It also reveals that the nonideal fluid mixing loss is sensitive to the average thermodynamic states of the mixing streams. A general trend is that the closer the temperature is to the critical point, the higher the loss is observed. This is particularly apparent for the temperature and pressure mixings, while the mixing loss due to the velocity difference is less affected. A significant variation of the mixing loss coefficient is reported if the static state of any of the two streams is near the critical point, which is mainly caused by the significant variation of the temperature gradient regarding the entropy along the isobar. In addition, a positive combined effect of the temperature, velocity, and pressure differences was found for mixing loss. The results also show that the change in the mixing loss due to the variation of one property difference between mixing streams is almost independent of the other property difference. This behavior matches the conclusion drawn in literature for perfect gases (Denton, J. D., 1993, ``The 1993 IGTI Scholar Lecture: Loss Mechanisms in Turbomachines,'' ASME J. Turbomach., 115(4), pp. 621--656). The results from this simple case contribute to understanding the mixing loss behavior differences between perfect gas and nonideal fluids in sCO2 turbomachinery and hold significance for the development of mean-line models.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a study of the turbulent boundary layer of supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) over an adiabatic flat plate using direct numerical simulation (DNS). As a non-ideal fluid, sCO2's non-ideal behaviors in the turbulent boundary layer are studied by comparing it with a perfect gas air case. Both the mean flow and the turbulent behaviors are investigated. In addition, the skin friction coefficient (Cf) and the dissipation coefficient (Cd) are analyzed due to their significance in engineering applications. The mean flow results reveal that sCO2 has lower temperature variation within the boundary layer than air due to its large Eckert number. By revising Walz's equation, it was found that Walz's equation in its classic form (using temperature ratios) fails to predict the temperature profile for sCO2, but its enthalpy form can accurately predict the enthalpy distribution. The viscosity of sCO2 displays liquid-like behavior inside the boundary layer. From the turbulent fluctuation behavior view, sCO2 boundary layer exhibits lower temperature fluctuations than air. Higher velocity fluctuation intensities are introduced due to local Reynolds number variation. Morkovin's hypothesis is still valid in sCO2 flow and no major differences are observed in the turbulent kinetic energy budget and velocity fluctuation intensities between sCO2 and air. Additionally, the van Driest II transformation for Cf relations is inapplicable for non-ideal compressible fluids, and the property ratio method is suggested as a promising alternative. Although the dissipation coefficient Cd is at a similar level for both air and sCO2 in this study, its components behave differently within the boundary layer due to the property variations.},
