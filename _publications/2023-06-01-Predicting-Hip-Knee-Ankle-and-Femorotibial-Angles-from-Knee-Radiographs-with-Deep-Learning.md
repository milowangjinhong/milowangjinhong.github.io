Abstract:
Background: Knee alignment affects the development and surgical treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Automating femorotibial angle (FTA) and hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA) measurement from radiographs could improve reliability and save time. Further, if HKA could be predicted from knee-only radiographs then radiation exposure could be reduced and the need for specialist equipment and personnel avoided. The aim of this research was to assess if deep learning methods could predict FTA and HKA angle from posteroanterior (PA) knee radiographs. Methods: Convolutional neural networks with densely connected final layers were trained to analyse PA knee radiographs from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database. The FTA dataset with 6149 radiographs and HKA dataset with 2351 radiographs were split into training, validation, and test datasets in a 70:15:15 ratio. Separate models were developed for the prediction of FTA and HKA and their accuracy was quantified using mean squared error as loss function. Heat maps were used to identify the anatomical features within each image that most contributed to the predicted angles. Results: High accuracy was achieved for both FTA (mean absolute error 0.8{$^\circ$}) and HKA (mean absolute error 1.7{$^\circ$}). Heat maps for both models were concentrated on the knee anatomy and could prove a valuable tool for assessing prediction reliability in clinical application. Conclusion: Deep learning techniques enable fast, reliable and accurate predictions of both FTA and HKA from plain knee radiographs and could lead to cost savings for healthcare providers and reduced radiation exposure for patients.
